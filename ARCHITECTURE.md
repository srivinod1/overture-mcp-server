# Overture Maps MCP Server — Architecture

## 1. Project Vision

An open-source MCP server that exposes Overture Maps data as reusable spatial analytics tools for AI agents. This is the **data layer** — raw geospatial intelligence that API-wrapper MCPs cannot provide.

### What This Server Does
- Spatial analytics: density analysis, building composition, admin boundary lookups
- Direct data access to Overture's open geospatial dataset via DuckDB + S3
- Composable primitives that agents combine to answer complex location questions

### What This Server Does NOT Do
- Geocoding (use a geocoding MCP)
- Routing/directions (use a routing MCP)
- ETA calculations (use a routing MCP)
- Map rendering or tile serving
- Real-time location tracking

### Design Principle
> When you want to know "what's here?" or "how does this area compare?" — that's Overture MCP.
> When you want to know "how do I get there?" or "what's the address for these coordinates?" — use a geocoding/routing MCP.

## 3. Key Decisions

### 3.1 Dual-Mode Tool Interface

The server supports two modes for exposing operations, controlled by the `TOOL_MODE` environment variable:

**Direct mode (`TOOL_MODE=direct`)** — **Default**

Each operation is registered as its own MCP tool. The agent sees all operations with full schemas at once:
```
Agent sees: places_in_radius, building_count_in_radius, point_in_admin_boundary, ...
Agent calls: places_in_radius({lat, lng, radius_m, category})
```

- One-step tool calls — the agent sees what's available and calls it directly.
- Compatible with all agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangChain, AutoGen, etc.).
- Trade-off: token overhead grows linearly with operation count.

**Progressive mode (`TOOL_MODE=progressive`)**

Operations are exposed through 3 meta-tools: `list_operations`, `get_operation_schema`, `execute_operation`. The agent discovers and fetches schemas on demand:
```
Turn 1: list_operations() → sees operation names + descriptions
Turn 1: get_operation_schema("places_in_radius") → gets full param schema
Turn 2: execute_operation("places_in_radius", {lat, lng, radius_m, category})
```

- Context overhead stays at ~300 tokens regardless of operation count.
- Follows the [code execution MCP pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp) recommended by Anthropic.
- Trade-off: requires multi-step discovery before first use.

**Why default to direct mode:**
- Most agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.) expect direct tool definitions at startup.
- At 7 operations (v1), the token overhead of direct mode is small (~2,000-3,000 tokens).
- Progressive mode becomes valuable when the operation count grows to 15+ and the server is used alongside many other MCPs.

Both modes use the same operation registry internally. Switching is a single env var change with no code or behavior differences.

### 3.2 Operation Registry (Internal Architecture)

All operations are defined in a central registry — a dictionary of operation definitions:

```python
{
    "places_in_radius": {
        "name": "places_in_radius",
        "description": "Find all places matching a category within a radius of a point",
        "parameters": { ... json schema ... },
        "handler": places_in_radius_handler,
        "theme": "places",
        "example": { ... }
    },
    ...
}
```

Both tool modes read from this registry. Adding a new operation means:
1. Write the query logic
2. Add an entry to the registry

In direct mode, the new operation automatically appears as a new MCP tool. In progressive mode, it appears in `list_operations` results. No changes to `server.py` in either case.

### 3.3 No Geocoding, No Routing
Other MCPs already handle geocoding, routing, and directions well via their APIs. We focus exclusively on spatial analytics that require direct data access — things those API wrappers cannot do.

### 3.4 Coordinates Only — No Address Inputs
All operations accept `(lat, lng)` as input. The agent is responsible for geocoding addresses via another MCP before calling Overture operations. This keeps our operations pure, fast, and dependency-free.

### 3.5 Meters for All Distances
Every radius/distance parameter uses meters. No unit conversion parameters. This matches spatial database conventions (PostGIS, DuckDB Spatial, H3).

### 3.6 Simplified JSON Responses (No Geometry by Default)
Operation responses return compact JSON optimized for agent token consumption:
- Count/density operations → numbers and summary stats
- Search operations → `{name, category, lat, lng, distance_m}`
- Optional `include_geometry=true` flag for map visualization use cases

Geometry is expensive in tokens and rarely needed for agent reasoning.

### 3.7 LLM-Native Category Discovery
Instead of a static lookup table mapping "coffee shop" → Overture category IDs, we expose `get_place_categories` as an operation that returns the real Overture taxonomy. The agent calls it, sees the actual categories, and picks the right one. This is self-updating, handles ambiguity naturally, and covers the long tail of user language.

### 3.8 Anonymous S3 Access
Overture's S3 bucket is publicly accessible. DuckDB queries it without AWS credentials:
```sql
SET s3_region='us-west-2';
-- No credentials needed
```
This eliminates AWS IAM configuration from deployment.

### 3.9 API Key Authentication
Simple `X-API-Key` header validation. The server reads `OVERTURE_API_KEY` from environment variables. No user management, no OAuth, no database — just a shared secret to prevent unauthorized usage.

### 3.10 Concurrency Control
`asyncio.Semaphore(3)` limits concurrent DuckDB queries to 3. DuckDB supports concurrent reads (we are read-only), but memory is the bottleneck on Railway's constrained environment. This prevents OOM from multiple large S3 scans running in parallel.

When all semaphore slots are in use, new requests queue (the coroutine blocks on `async with semaphore`). No request is dropped. The 30-second query timeout applies per-query, not including queue wait time. If a query errors or times out, the semaphore is always released via `async with` (or try/finally). This guarantees no deadlocks.

### 3.11 SQL Injection Prevention
All user-provided string values (`category`, `query`) are handled via **parameterized queries** using DuckDB's `execute(sql, params)` with `?` placeholders. User strings never appear in SQL via f-string interpolation or string concatenation.

Additionally, `category` values are validated against the cached taxonomy before reaching SQL. If a category is not in the cache, the server returns an error immediately without querying S3. This provides a second layer of defense.

Numeric values (`lat`, `lng`, `radius_m`, `limit`) are type-validated (must be int or float within documented ranges) before reaching the query layer.

### 3.12 Spatial Filtering Strategy
Radius-based queries use a two-stage spatial filter:

1. **Bounding box pre-filter** (fast, approximate): Convert the radius from meters to approximate degree deltas and filter using Parquet bbox metadata. DuckDB skips irrelevant row groups entirely.
2. **Spheroid distance filter** (accurate): `ST_Distance_Spheroid(geometry, point) < radius_m` for exact meter-based filtering.

This ensures the `distance_m` returned in results is consistent with the filter boundary — a place reported as 495m away will never appear when querying with a 500m radius and vice versa. `ST_DWithin` is NOT used because it operates in the geometry's coordinate units (degrees for lon/lat), not meters.

### 3.13 Coordinate Order
Operations accept `(lat, lng)` — latitude first, longitude second. Internally, DuckDB's `ST_Point` takes `(lng, lat)` — X before Y per GIS convention. The server handles this conversion. Callers always use `(lat, lng)`.

### 3.14 Geometry Size Cap
When `include_geometry=true`, WKT geometry strings are capped at 10,000 characters. If a geometry exceeds this (e.g., a complex country boundary polygon), it is omitted from the result with a note: `"geometry_note": "Geometry too large (>10,000 chars). Omitted to save tokens."` This prevents large polygons from the divisions theme from consuming agent context.

### 3.15 Structured Empty Results
Zero results is valid data, not an error. Response format:
```json
{
  "results": [],
  "count": 0,
  "query_params": {"lat": 52.37, "lng": 4.89, "radius_m": 500, "category": "bank"},
  "suggestion": "No banks found within 500m. Try increasing radius to 1000m."
}
```
Agents need structured data to reason and self-correct.

### 3.16 Overture Data Version
Current: `2026-01-21.0`. Overture releases quarterly. The data version is configured as a single constant — updating to a new release is a one-line change.

---

## 4. MCP Interface

### Direct Mode (Default)

Each operation in the registry is registered as its own MCP tool with full parameter schemas. With 7 v1 operations, the agent sees 7 tools.

### Progressive Mode

3 MCP tools are registered. They never change as operations are added.

| Tool | Parameters | Returns | Latency |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `list_operations` | None | Array of `{name, description, theme}` | <10ms |
| `get_operation_schema` | `operation` (string) | Full JSON schema + example | <10ms |
| `execute_operation` | `operation` (string), `params` (object) | Standard response envelope | 1-5s |

---

## 5. V1 Operations (7 Operations)

These are operations within the registry, not MCP tools.

### Theme: Places (4 operations)

| Operation | Purpose | Key Params |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `get_place_categories` | Browse/search Overture category taxonomy | `query` (optional) |
| `places_in_radius` | Find all places matching category in radius | `lat, lng, radius_m, category` |
| `nearest_place_of_type` | Find single closest place of type X | `lat, lng, category` |
| `count_places_by_type_in_radius` | Count places of a category in area | `lat, lng, radius_m, category` |

### Theme: Buildings (2 operations)

| Operation | Purpose | Key Params |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `building_count_in_radius` | Count buildings in area | `lat, lng, radius_m` |
| `building_class_composition` | % breakdown of building types | `lat, lng, radius_m` |

### Theme: Divisions (1 operation)

| Operation | Purpose | Key Params |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `point_in_admin_boundary` | What country/region/city contains this point | `lat, lng` |

### Future Operations (Not in V1)
- `place_density_analysis` — places per km² for category in area
- `competitive_overlap` — compare competitor density at multiple locations
- `building_attributes` — height, year built, class for specific building
- `total_building_area_in_radius` — sum of building footprints
- `nearest_road` / `road_count_by_type` — road theme operations
- `admin_boundary_hierarchy` — full chain of boundaries

Adding any of these is a registry entry + query logic. No MCP interface changes.

---

## 6. Response Format Standard

All operations follow a consistent response envelope:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "count": 3,
  "query_params": {
    "lat": 52.3676,
    "lng": 4.9041,
    "radius_m": 500,
    "category": "coffee_shop"
  },
  "data_version": "2026-01-21.0",
  "suggestion": null
}
```

**Fields:**
- `results` — Array of result objects (operation-specific schema). Empty array for zero results.
- `count` — Integer count of results.
- `query_params` — Echo of the input parameters (helps agents verify what was queried).
- `data_version` — Overture release version used.
- `suggestion` — Null when results exist. Helpful hint when results are empty (e.g., "Try increasing radius to 1000m").

**Optional geometry:**
When `include_geometry=true` is passed, each result object includes a `geometry` field with WKT string.

**Separation of concerns:**
- `server.py` — MCP tool registration (direct or progressive mode). Thin layer that delegates to the registry.
- `registry.py` — Central catalog of all operations. Maps names → schemas + handlers.
- `operations/` — Operation handlers (parameter validation, response shaping).
- `queries/` — Pure SQL query builders. No MCP or registry knowledge. Testable independently.
- `db.py` — Single place for DuckDB connection lifecycle and concurrency control.
- `response.py` — Single place for the response envelope format.

## 8. Data Access Patterns

### S3 Path Template
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/{VERSION}/theme={THEME}/type={TYPE}/
```

### Paths Used in V1
```
theme=places/type=place/          → Places operations
theme=buildings/type=building/    → Building operations
theme=divisions/type=division_area/  → Admin boundary operations
```

### Spatial Query Pattern (Two-Stage Filter)
All radius-based queries use a two-stage spatial filter:

**Stage 1 — Bounding box pre-filter (degrees, fast):**
DuckDB uses Parquet row group statistics to skip irrelevant files entirely. The bbox deltas are computed from the radius in meters converted to approximate degrees.

**Stage 2 — Spheroid distance filter (meters, accurate):**
`ST_Distance_Spheroid` computes true Earth-surface distance in meters.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2026-01-21.0/theme=places/type=place/*')
WHERE bbox.xmin BETWEEN ? AND ?          -- Stage 1: bbox pre-filter
  AND bbox.ymin BETWEEN ? AND ?
  AND ST_Distance_Spheroid(geometry, ST_Point(?, ?)) < ?   -- Stage 2: exact meters
  AND categories.primary = ?             -- parameterized, not interpolated
```

`ST_DWithin` is NOT used because it operates in the geometry's coordinate units (degrees for lon/lat data), not meters.

---

## 9. Configuration

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OVERTURE_API_KEY` | Yes | API key for client authentication |
| `TOOL_MODE` | No | `direct` (default) or `progressive` — how operations are exposed as MCP tools |
| `OVERTURE_DATA_VERSION` | No | Override data version (default: `2026-01-21.0`) |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` | No | Semaphore limit (default: `3`) |
| `MAX_RADIUS_M` | No | Safety cap on radius queries (default: `50000` / 50km) |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default: `8000`) |

### Safety Limits
- Max radius: 50km (prevents full-table scans)
- Max results per query: 100 (prevents token explosion in agent responses)
- Query timeout: 30 seconds (prevents hung queries on cold S3 reads)

---

## 10. Deployment

### Target: Railway
- Runtime: Python 3.10+
- Estimated cost: $5-10/month
- No persistent storage needed (DuckDB is in-process, queries S3 directly)

### Container
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN pip install .
COPY src/ src/
CMD ["python", "-m", "overture_mcp.server"]
```

### Health Check
Expose `/health` endpoint that:
1. Confirms DuckDB can query S3 (runs a trivial count query)
2. Returns data version and server uptime

---

## 11. Performance Expectations

| Operation | Expected Latency | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| `list_operations` | <10ms | In-memory registry read |
| `get_operation_schema` | <10ms | In-memory registry read |
| `get_place_categories` | <100ms | Cached on server startup |
| `places_in_radius` (500m) | 1-3s | S3 cold read + spatial filter |
| `places_in_radius` (5km) | 2-5s | Larger scan area |
| `building_count_in_radius` | 1-3s | Count-only, no data transfer |
| `point_in_admin_boundary` | 2-5s | Division boundaries are large geometries |

First query after cold start will be slower (DuckDB initializes S3 connection, loads Parquet metadata). Subsequent queries benefit from metadata caching.

---

## 12. Versioning & Updates

- **Server version**: Semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
- **Data version**: Tracks Overture release (2026-01-21.0). Updated quarterly.
- **Breaking changes**: New major version. Old operations never change signatures — only add new operations.
- **Data update process**: Change `OVERTURE_DATA_VERSION` env var, redeploy. No migration needed.
- **Adding operations**: Registry entry + query logic. No MCP interface changes. Non-breaking by design.

---

## 13. Future Roadmap (Post-V1)

### V2 — More Operations
- Place density analysis
- Competitive overlap
- Building attributes (height, year built)
- Total building area
- Road theme operations (nearest road, road types, restrictions)
- Admin boundary hierarchy

All added as registry entries. No MCP interface changes.

### V3 — Performance
- Parquet metadata caching
- Pre-computed spatial indexes for hot regions
- Result caching (Redis or in-memory LRU)
- Batch query support (multiple points in one call)

### V4 — Advanced
- Temporal analysis (compare across Overture releases)
- Custom area analysis (polygon input, not just radius)
- Cross-theme joins (buildings + places + roads in one query)
- Streaming large result sets
